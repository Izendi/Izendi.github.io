Re-recording of a presentation on Tiled Shading I gave to my Computer Graphics Class. The 2011 paper explaining technique can be found at: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232836241_Tiled_Shading

## Overview
Tiled shading is a technique that aims to improve the efficiency of rendering a real-time scene with multiple light sources. It does this by bucketing lights into screen space tiles. (Watch the presentation linked above for in depth details)

The presentation first describes how forward and deferred shading works, before showing how tiled shading addresses issues with those techniques to further improve on performance.
I also wrote about forward and deferred shading on a blog post (which uses the same structure as the presentation to describe the differences)
