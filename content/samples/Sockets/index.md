## Introduction

Embarrassingly, I've never looked into sockets much. You hear the term a lot, and for a long time I was content with simply understanding it as a way to have two applications communicate with each other either over a network on the same device.
Every time I'd open a book page or website on sockets my eyes would begin to glaze over and I'd put it off for another time. 
But that ends today. 
This is my deep (relatively) dive into sockets.

## Overview (What are they)
So what are sockets. Well according to ChatGPT they are "Sockets are communication endpoints that enable data exchange between devices or processes over a network, using IP addresses and port numbers to establish connections."

And according to Wikipedia "A network socket is a software structure within a network node of a computer network that serves as an endpoint for sending and receiving data across the network. The structure and properties of a socket are defined by an application programming interface (API) for the networking architecture." [<a href="#ref1">1</a>\]

For something seemingly simple, there is a lot to them.
