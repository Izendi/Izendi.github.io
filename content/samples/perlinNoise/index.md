Using Perlin noise for procedural terrain generation.
{{< /lead >}}

## NOTE (Page Unfinished): 

**This page is unfinished and mostly incomplete**

## Examples

Code uses examples from Daniel Shiffman's book 'The Nature of Code': https://github.com/nature-of-code/noc-book-2/blob/main/content/examples/00_randomness/example_i_6_perlin_noise_walker/sketch.js

For my procedural world project, go to: [Procedural World Using Perlin Noise](../Procedural-World-PN)
